# VersionControlExample
This is for the crash course from GameDev HQ on Version Control

   The focus of this repos. is to use a command line interface instead of a GUI to get a more hands-on to the processes in Git. A successful programmer is able to use a variety of version control systems to better match what is expected for each project.
